The unified test-runner allows all (3) regression testsuites to be run with
a single command (run-tests). This can include the unit testsuite, the
expect testsuite and the python testsuite.

To run the testsuites using the unified test-runner:

* Slurm must first be installed, configured and running.
* Running make install will create a testsuite/testsuite.conf file in your
  build directory having populated some basic defaults for the testsuite.
  Review and edit testsuite.conf if necessary.
* If your build directory is separate from your source directory, you will
  need to set the SLURM_TESTSUITE_CONF environment variable to the full path
  of your testsuite.conf before executing the unified test-runner.
* pytest (pytest-3) must be installed in order to run the python testsuite.
* expect must be installed in order to run the expect testsuite.
* If perldoc is installed, ./run-tests --man can be used to display a man page
  for the test-runner.
* Execute run-tests with the desired options to run the testsuites
